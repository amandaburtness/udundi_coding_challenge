Udundi Coding Challenge README : 

Languages used: 
- SASS, HTML, Javascript, Bootstrap Framework

Other things to know: 
- I used the SASS compilier within VSCode. 

This project is a main page for a mock website. I do not own any of this content - it was given to me by the team at Udundi for a coding challenge. 

This page has two buttons that go to Facebook and Instagram, and another button that opens a pop up, using Javascript for more details about the page. With the pop-up, I added an overlay using SASS and Javascript to make the modal pop up, pop more on the page. 

The icons for the buttons are svg files, linked in the SASS file. I used animation on the page load for a more fluid look to the page that I felt goes with the "explore" aesthetic, as well as animation for the pop up when opened and closed. 

The background framework is created by using the Bootstrap grid system. The styling of the page is created with SASS, incorporating variables and nesting. In the styling for animation, keyframes are used in conjunction with translate and transform. 

Thank you so much for taking a look at my code! If you have any feedback that would make this page better, let me know! Thank you again!
